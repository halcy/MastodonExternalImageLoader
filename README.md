# MastodonExternalImageLoader
Loads media-reject images client side using a userscript. Install in Greasemonkey, then change the URL to your masto instance.

Remaining issues:
* Lightbox only works if there is another image loaded that it can be stolen from
* Lightbox only works for single images at a time, image switching does not work
* Could also try loading avatars on user view
